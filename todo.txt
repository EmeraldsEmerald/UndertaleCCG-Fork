Special The White Palace Wording



Look into how to detect when a websocket closes.

TODO immediate:
Create a look at menu


Bugs that are hard to replicate. If this happens to you, please tell me.
Sometimes on the lookatmenu cardFrameState can bug out and become normal. This is fixed by reloading, but prevents you selecting it until you reload.
There is a phantom space between some pieces of card space. Very consistent, no clue why.
